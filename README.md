# Online-University-Management

Designing an Online University Management System.<br>
The main aim of the project is to develop an application which would facilitate the students, faculties, warden and librarian to do all the tasks in an efficient manner.<br>
We have used Linked Data Structure to store the information retrieved from the ( .dat ) files.

Technologies used:

C++ ( File Handling, Console Handlers, OOPS, Data Structures ) <br>

---

# Structure

admin.dat => This file contains the details of admin such as his login credentials and profile details <br>

student.dat => This file will be generated as soon as the admin creates an account for the student. This file stores all the details about students such as his name, registration number, courses, and many more which are stored in one single line. <br>

faculty.dat => This file will stores the details about each faculty such their profile, students registered under them, login credentials, courses, and many more. <br>

warden.dat => This file will stores the details about each students attendance list which can be modified by warden. <br>

librarian.dat => This file will stores the details about books present in the library and details regarding the lending of books and dues for the students. <br>
